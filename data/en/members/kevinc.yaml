bio: "Co-fonder of inSileco, associate researcher at the University of Guelph, open and reproducible research advocate. For almost ten years now, I have been tackling research challenges in various areas of ecology. I have mainly been focusing on theory in macro-ecology and network ecology, but I have also been working on various topics such as epidemics, forest dynamics, meta-ecosystems and food security. I have been facing a wide array of technical problems and have acquired a very broad set of quantitative and computational skills."
