description: | 
  The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests (MRNF) conducted a comprehensive ecological survey of southern Quebec, involving more than 25,000 observation points, which was used to develop a hierarchical system for ecological classification. This system is based on vegetation classification using inventory data and allows for the definition of indicator species groups, forest types, and potential vegetation. The classification plays a major role in land management and is subject to ongoing evaluation, particularly due to climate change. We contributed to supporting part of the research on these classifications by making recent analyses fully reproducible through the creation of an R package.
