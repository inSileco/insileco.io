  The objective of this project was to update the assessment of cumulative effects on the food webs of the Scotian Shelf Bioregion with new data from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans on the distribution of beaked whale habitat and trophic relationships, and create a proof of concept interactive application to explore the assessment at the species scale. The expected outcomes of this project were to enhance our understanding of endangered beaked whale species and their ecosystem dynamics, ultimately leading to more effective management strategies and better-informed decision-making processes.
