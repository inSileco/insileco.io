description: | 
  We helped conceive and develop a Shiny app for the GOTeDNA project, which provides guidance on optimal eDNA sampling periods for effective monitoring programs. Our team worked closely with the GOTeDNA team to create an intuitive, user-friendly tool that enabled researchers to input environmental data, analyze sampling conditions, and receive recommendations for the best sampling times. By combining our technical expertise in Shiny app development with the scientific principles from GOTeDNA, we supported the optimization and interpretation of eDNA sampling strategies for biodiversity monitoring.
