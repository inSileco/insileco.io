description: | 
  We developped a Shiny Application to generate reproducible reports for species at risk. After the release of the second version of the application, we enhanced the capabilities of DFO staff by providing training to maintain and further develop the application. The application is now actively maintained and developed by DFO (see [DFO repository](https://github.com/dfo-mar-odis/shinySpatialApp)).
