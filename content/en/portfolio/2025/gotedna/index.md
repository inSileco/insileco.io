  As part of a multi-year initiative, the Nunatsiavut Government, in partnership with Environment and Climate Change Canada and SeaDuck Joint Venture, has been tracking marine birds to better understand their origin, key habitats, and the threats these birds face on their way to and from Labrador Inuit lands and waters. These projects have been developed in response to community concerns and priorities around wild food and bird populations. We developed an Shiny app to provide an intuitive user interface to visualize these data. Additionally, we created a data pipeline to ensure the app's data remains up-to-date, enabling seamless tracking and management of bird observations.
